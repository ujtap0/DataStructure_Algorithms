// linked list: consist of a bunch of els with no indices (difference between array and linked list)
// linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer(reference) to another node or null
// it contains a head, tail and length property
// head: beginning of the linked list
// tail: end of the linked list
// SO WE DON'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERY SINGLE ITEM IN THE MIDDLE => WE JUST KEEP TRACK OF THE HEAD AND FROM THE HEAD WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE NEXT ONE
// in array => every single item would have to be re-indexed to get a new position number

// 2. connected via nodes with a next pointer
// 3. random access is not allowed

//array
